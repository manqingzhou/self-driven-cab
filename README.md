# self-driven-cab
PROBLEM:
We aim to create a self-driving cab, its job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. This cab will also take care of:
Drop off the passenger to the right location.
Save passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off
Take care of passenger's safety and traffic rules
